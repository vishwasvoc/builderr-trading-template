"""Live leaderboard runner — produces real, daily-refreshed standings for the
reference ("house") bots on LIVE market data. A GitHub Action runs this each
market day and commits leaderboard.json; the site reads it.

This is honest content, not fakery:
  • The bots are the real reference strategies + admitted entrants in this repo.
  • Numbers are COMPUTED from running them on real daily bars (yfinance), never hardcoded.
  • Each runs a $100,000 paper account from ROUND_START (Jun 2) to the latest bar, and
    we report the simple, human numbers: account value, P&L, and trades.

It reuses the same fill model and metrics as preview.py, so a bot scores here the
same way it would in the real eval.

    python live_runner.py            # writes leaderboard.json

Needs: yfinance (installed in the Action). Not part of the no-dep builder workflow.
